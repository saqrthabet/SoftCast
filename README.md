# SoftCast: One-Size-Fits-All Wireless Video

### The Matlab code for the joint source and channel coding based wireless transmission system (SoftCast) demonstrated in the paper titled: SoftCast: One-Size-Fits-All Wireless Video.

## * Main features:
### -The aim of this contribution is to show how different multimedia files (2D pictures, 2D videos, and 3D videos) are processed, transmitted and received based on the original SoftCast work.
### -Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Channel model is used in this simulation.
### -Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) is used as a standard metric of video quality.
### -The transmission is performed across a range of different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values, or different channel gain.
